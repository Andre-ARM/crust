menu "Debugging options"

config ASSERT
	bool "Enable runtime assertion checking"
	default y
	help
		Enable assert() logic to validate assumptions and find
		bugs at runtime. If in doubt, say Y.

config ASSERT_VERBOSE
	bool "Report information about failed assertions"
	depends on ASSERT
	help
		When an assertion fails, print detailed information
		about it to the console. This includes the expression
		that was checked, as well as the file and line number of
		the call to assert().

		Enabling this option makes it significantly easier to
		find the code that triggered an assertion failure. Note
		that this option significantly increases the size of the
		final firmware binary. If in doubt, say N.

config COMPILE_TEST
	bool "Allow compiling a firmware that does not run"
	help
		Some combinations of options may not make sense or may
		not produce a functional firmware, for example if the
		firmware becomes too large, or if it contains multiple
		drivers for the same piece of hardware.

		This is mostly useful for development and automated
		testing. Users should say N.

config DEBUG_INFO
	bool "Compile the firmware with debug info"
	default y
	help
		When compiling the firmware, generate debug information
		for use with gdb. These are stripped out of the final
		firmware binary, so this option does not affect the
		loaded firmware size. If in doubt, say Y.

config DEBUG_LOG
	bool "Print additional debug-level log messages"
	help
		This enables the debug() logging macro to print verbose
		informational messages that may aid in debugging.

config DEBUG_PRINT_LATENCY
	bool "Print average latency after each state transition"
	help
		After each system state transition, calculate the
		average latency of the main loop, in AR100 clock cycles.
		The latency will be printed after the firmware has
		performed 1 million iterations in that state.

config DEBUG_PRINT_SPRS
	bool "Print the contents of Special Purpose Registers at boot"
	help
		The OpenRISC 1000 architecture defines various Special
		Purpose Registers, or SPRs, that describe the particular
		CPU implementation. Enable this option to print a subset
		of these SPRs in a human-readable format during boot.
